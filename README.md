This module aims to provide solution to create, manage, vote and see results of Polls in Chat Log during games played via Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## Usage

To create a poll, use `/poll` chat command. First line becomes the question.

Each of next lines becomes an answer. Use Shift+Enter to go to new line when writing a message

Example:

```
/p Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
Stupid answer
Dumb answer
Just answer
Barely answer
42
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```
